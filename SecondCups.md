## Second Cup Coffees

A living list of coffees that, after having the first cup, I wanted another.

## How do you decide what coffees get included?

See above. But for real, that's a good question. I just don't have a proportionally good answer to this question at the moment.

## How are you preparing these coffees?

For consistency, all coffees – to date and going forward – will be prepared via pour over. See "Set Up" for details.
