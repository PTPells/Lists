#### Second Cups
*A living list of coffees that, after having the first cup, I wanted another.*

**Roaster** | **Type** | **Origin** | **Name/Region** | **First Cup** | **Notes**
|:---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |:----|  
La Colombe* | single origin | China-Yunnan | Fuyan County, Yunnan Province | 24 Nov 2018 | Smooth and balanced with a milk-chocolate sweetness. Eager to try it again to unpack what else is going on in there.|
Blue Bottle | single origin | North Sumatra, Indonesia | *Sumatra Lake Toba Blue Batak* | 6 November 2018 | It's almost like each sip has "time"...it starts with a pleasant acidity that turns into sweetness and finishes with the richness and silkiness of coconut oil without overwhelming at any point.
Verve | single origin | Guatemala | *Santa Clara Pacamara* | October, 2018 | Subtly sharp, with just enough sweetness to make inoffensive. Good body. Drinks like a cup of coffee i could have many times, not tire of and continue to find new things to notice.
Home roasted | single origin | Ethiopia | *Hambela Hassan* | August, 2018 | bright with body; delightful for the morning |
heart | single origin | Colombia | *Fabio Escobar* | August, 2018 |
Ritual | single origin | Colombia | *El Guamo* | July, 2018
Verve | single origin | Honduras | *El Brujo* | July, 2018
Equator | single origin | Costa Rica | *Costa Rica Beneficio Santa Rosa 1900* | July, 2018
George Howell | single origin | Rwanda | *Kanzu* |  April, 2018
Wrecking Ball | single origin | Peru | *Peru Saltillo Finca Tasta* |  April, 2018
Blue Bottle | single origin | Guatemala | *Cob√°n Santa Isabel Caturra* |  January, 2018
