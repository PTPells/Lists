###  On naming conventions
+ [ ] What kinds of notes/docs do I anticipate having?
	+ Affect **frequently**:
			- daily notes
			- living lists
			- ideas (i.e. "faith," "conversations," "collaboration")
	+ Affect **infrequently:**
		- reference (about)
		- projects
	+ Static
		- tbd

###  Observations
+ I'm finding it easier to recall what I've been spending my time thinking about/doing
+ "Committing" each night feels good
+ I enjoy not having [the option] to think about formatting when writing*
+ Document/notes don't feel "precious"
+ Freeing knowing .md files compatible with most services*

\**A Better Mess speaks well to these in this [post](http://bettermess.com/a-plain-text-primer/)*

###  Consider

	- [Retrospective Format (Team Practices Group)](Team Practices Group )

- Research
- Questions
- People
- Books
- Public vs. private
- Collaboration
- "Writing"
- Questions
- Linking between notes/documents (i.e. write a daily note about one of Wilfred Bion's ideas. Wilfred Bion first mentioned in [rn-Cognitive_Surplus](/rn-cognitive-surplus.md)
