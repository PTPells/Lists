## Features
The kinds of behavior I'd like for "this" to encourage:
+ Begin broad, grow specific
+ Start parts easily
	+ Only think about writing when I'm writing (limited formatting options)
		+ See [WikiWikiWeb's](http://wiki.c2.com/?AddingNewPages) and [NV's](http://notational.net/) models for easy creation
	+ Not to worry about making a mess while writing knowing I have the ability to easily go back and make sense of things
	+ Not to get hung up on thinking how something fits into the broader whole
+ Contributing frequently
	+ Provide satisfaction no matter the size of the contribution
+ Identify relationships between component parts and relate them (i.e. linking, lists) when suitable
	+ See MediaWiki's \[[ ]] shorthand for intra-wiki linking
+ Thinking of all content as living, dynamic, in process...not static
+ Systems should grow with as little effort as possible
+ Content that makes up knowledge base should be easily portable (exporting and importing)
+ Encourages you to add to it incrementally - you can *feel* its cumulative nature


## Language
 "Parts" for documents/notes/articles and "wholes"
 for aggregations/lists/categories.


## Misc.
+ This is as much a "tool" it is a process...a set of workflows. Kind of funny to think how something as conscious as thinking can be so unconscious. If that makes sense.
+ Legibility. "Being clear enough to be read."
+ I want it to be easy for me to know, at all times, what I
think, what I think about and to be able to trace both back
to their origins as best I can without having to consider
these future workflows while i'm actually writing.  

	> i.e. when i read, i note quotes that standout to me in the document I've created for that book. I also keep a separate "master" document of *all* the resonant quotes I've noted over time. It would be nice for there to be a way for me to collate all of the quotes i've collected, across documents, in a "master" document-like format without ever needing to create or maintain said list and do it on the fly.

+ I'm finding it easier to recall what I've been spending my time thinking about/doing  
+ "Committing" each night feels good  
+ I enjoy not having [the option] to think about formatting when writing*  
+ Document/notes don't feel "precious"  
+ Freeing knowing .md files are portable
