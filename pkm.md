## framework

“If you want to teach people a new way of thinking, don’t bother trying to teach them. Instead, give them a tool, the use of which will lead to new ways of thinking.”

— R. Buckminster Fuller

*On formalizing the workflows I've intuited so far...*

###  Observations
+ I'd like for the design of this to encourage me to just "get started" – to expect me to make a mess while giving me the power to go back and make sense of my chaos
	+ Example: When i read, i note quotes that standout to me in the document I've created for that book. I also keep a separate "master" document of *all* the resonant quotes I've noted over time. It would be nice for there to be a way for me to collate all of the quotes i've collected, across documents, in a "master" document-like format without ever needing to create or contain maintaining said list and do it on the fly. search?
+ I'd like the ability to seamlessly link across documents (i.e. Media Wiki's "[[ ]]" shorthand)
+ "documents" that don't get affected don't feel good
+ I'm finding it easier to recall what I've been spending my time thinking about/doing
+ "Committing" each night feels good
+ I enjoy not having [the option] to think about formatting when writing*
+ Document/notes don't feel "precious"
+ Freeing knowing .md files compatible with most services*

###  On naming conventions
+ [ ] What language should "list-like" documents be written in? YAML? Markdown?
	+ See: Ben Balter's [Books](https://github.com/benbalter/benbalter.github.com/blob/master/_data/books.yml)
+ [ ] What kinds of notes/docs do I anticipate having?
	+ Affect **frequently**:
			- daily notes
			- living lists
			- ideas (i.e. "faith," "conversations," "collaboration")
	+ Affect **infrequently:**
		- reference (about)
		- projects
	+ Static
		- tbd
