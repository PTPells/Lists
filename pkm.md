## PKM

*On formalizing the workflows I've intuited so far...*


###  Observations
- I'm finding it easier to recall what I've been spending my time thinking about/doing
- "Committing" each night feels good
- I enjoy not having [the option] to think about formatting when writing
- Document/notes don't feel "precious"
- Freeing knowing .md files compatible with most services

###  Consider
- Templates
- Research
- Questions
- People
- Books
- Public vs. private
- Collaboration
- "Writing"
- Questions
