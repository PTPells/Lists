+ Room for the River   [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Room_for_the_River_(Netherlands)) | [Dutch gov't](https://www.ruimtevoorderivier.nl/english/)
  + An [approach](https://albertawater.com/how-is-water-governed/what-is-room-for-the-river#ftnt3) to flood mitigation whereby measures are taken to provide rivers more "room" when they swell during heavy rainfall. This contrasts with earlier approaches where berms and dikes were used to constrain rivers and prevent them from flooding nearby people and infrastructure.

  + I wonder if this is another way of articulating what I've been wondering about how different peoples' ideas of a broader subject fit together into a cogent whole. Well, now that I write this out, maybe what I'm really asking is "how do I integrate outside knowledge into my own?""
+ [Distributed cognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_cognition)
  + Example: working out a math problem with a friend on paper. Here, arriving at the answer–"intelligence"-involves:
    + 1) the perception of both people involved
    + 2) a tool (paper)
  It also requires a level of communication so this information can be shared between people and across media (paper)
