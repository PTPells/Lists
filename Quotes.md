**Christopher Alexander** [*A City is Not a Tree*](https://www.patternlanguage.com/archive/cityisnotatree.html#)
  > The playground, asphalted and fenced in, is nothing but a pictorial acknowledgment of the fact that 'play' exists as an isolated concept in our minds.

**Kevin Lynch** *The Image of the City*
  > Any existing, functioning urban area has structure and identity, even if only in weak measure...A frequent problem is the sensitive reshaping of an already existing environment: discovering and preserving its strong images, solving its perceptual difficulties, and, above all, drawing out the structure and identity latent in the confusion.


**Simon Nicholson** [*Theory of Loose Parts*](https://media.kaboom.org/docs/documents/pdf/ip/Imagination-Playground-Theory-of-Loose-Parts-Simon-Nicholson.pdf)
  > In any environment, both the degree of inventiveness and creativity, and the possibility of discovery, are directly proportional to the number and kind of variables in it.


**Michael Pollan** *A Place of My Own*
  > A frame always implies a point of view, the presence of some order principle or sensibility.

**Freeman Dyson** *Not sure*
  > Human societies are glued together with conversation and friendship. Conversation is the natural and characteristic activity of human beings. Friendship is the milieu within which we function.

**Witold Rybczynski** *
> Homeyness is not neatness. Otherwise everyone would live in replicas of the kinds of sterile and impersonal homes that appear in interior-design and architectural magazines. What these spotless rooms lack, or what crafty photographers have carefully removed, is any evidence of human occupation. In spite of the artfully placed vases and casually arranged art books, the imprint of their inhabitants is missing. Can people really live without clutter?

  > Any existing, functioning urban area has structure and identity, even if only in weak measure...A frequent problem is the sensitive reshaping of an already existing environment: discovering and preserving its strong images, solving its perceptual difficulties, and, above all, drawing out the structure and identity latent in the confusion.

**John B. Jackson** [*A Sense of Place, A Sense of Time*](https://newprairiepress.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&httpsredir=1&article=1111&context=oz)
  > We fail to see "social uniqueness" because most of us establish the sense of place not by its forms, its spaces and structures, but by the way it tells time, by the sequence of daily, weekly, yearly events.

**Ralph Waldo Emerson** [*Self-Reliance*](https://archive.vcu.edu/english/engweb/transcendentalism/authors/emerson/essays/selfreliance.html)
  > The voyage of the best ship is a zigzag line of a hundred tacks.

**Susan Sontag** [*Notes on Camp*](https://monoskop.org/images/5/59/Sontag_Susan_1964_Notes_on_Camp.pdf)
  > Any sensibility which can be crammed into the mold of a system, or handled with the rough tools of proof, is no longer a sensibility at all. It has hardened into an idea.

**Marshall McLuhan** *The Gutenberg Galaxy p. 179*
  > ...the printed word is an arrested moment of mental movement.

**Kevin Lynch** *The Image of the City*
  > ...a distinctive and legible environment not only offers security but also heightens the potential depth and intensity of human experience. Although life is far from impossible in the visual chaos of the modern city, the same daily action could take on new meaning if carried out in a more vivid setting.

**Edmund Leach** [*Reith Lectures*](http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/rmhttp/radio4/transcripts/1967_reith3.pdf)
  > This act of listening and understanding is an act of submission on your part.

**Bret Victor**
  > ...power of an idea lies in the form in which it’s expressed because that’s what allows people to think it.

**Albert Camus** *Create Dangerously*
  > ..freedom is not a gift received from a state or a leader but a possession to be own every day by the effort of each and the union of all.

**Federico Fellini**
  > A different language is a different vision of life.

**Christopher Alexander** [*Making the Graden*](https://www.firstthings.com/article/2016/02/making-the-garden)
  > To have something solid that I could be sure of, I started by examining the smallest particles of functional effect that I could discern in buildings, paying attention to small and sometimes barely significant aspects of the ways that buildings affect people. My purpose in doing this was to focus on the smallest particles of fact that I could be certain of: something that was extraordinarily difficult given the porridge of mush that then passed for architectural theory. In those early years, my studies were based on the most ordinary, minuscule observations about usefulness and the effect of buildings on the people who lived in them, always keeping the observations modest, ­reliable, and detailed—small enough and solid enough that I could be sure that they were true.

**Michael Pollan** *A Place of My Own*
  > Certain architectural configurations...survivie simply because they have proven over time to be a good way to reconcile human needs, the laws of nature, the facts of the human body, and the materials at hand.

**Robert Venturi, Denise Scott Brown and Steven Izenour** *Learning from Las Vegas*
  > It is all right to decorate construction but never construct decoration.

**Witold Rybczynski** *Home*
  > Contemporary designers are not interested in variations; they want a brand-new score. They want to develop solutions on their own, without the aid of paradigms, and so their work has to be judged primarily according to its novelty. This has led to a 'cult of originality,' as Allan Greenberg has called it, in which 'What's new?' is more frequently asked than 'What's better?'...under such circumstances gradual evolution becomes impossible; to adapt some else's design is to be accused of a lack of imagination, and to improve one's own is to admit that it was not perfect in the first place.

**Kevin Lynch** *The Image of the City*
  > ...education in seeing will be quite important as the reshaping of what is seen. Indeed, they together form a circular, or hopefully a spiral, process: visual education impelling the citizen to act upon his visual world, and this action causing him to see even more acutely. A highly developed art of urban design is linked to the creation of a critical and attentive audience. If art and audience grow together, then our cities will be a source of daily enjoyment to millions of their inhabitants.

**Kevin Lynch** *The Image of the City*
  > The observer himself should play an active role in perceiving the world and have a creative part in developing his image...an environment which is ordered in precise and final detail may inbibit the new patterns of activity. A landscape whose every rock tells a story may make difficult the creation of fresh stories.

**William Ivins** *Prints and Visual Communication*
  > Thus the more closely we can confine our data for reasoning about things to data that come to us through one and the same sense channel the more apt we are to be correct in our reasoning, even though it be much more restricted in its scope. One of the most interesting things in our modern scientific practice has been the invention and perfection of methods by which the scientist can acquire much of their basic data through one and the same sensuous channel of awareness. I understand that in physics, for example the scientists are the happiest when they can get their data with the aid of some dial or some device which can be read by vision. Thus heat, weight, lengths, and many other things that in ordinary life are apprehended through senses other than vision have become for science matter of visual awareness of the positions of mechanical pointers.


**Robert Venturi, Denise Scott Brown and Steven Izenour** *Learning from Las Vegas*
  > We look backward at history and tradition to go forward; we can also look downward to go upward. And withholding judgement may be used as a tool to make later judgement more sensitive. This is a way of learning from everything.

**Dominque Foray** *Economics of Knowledge*
  > There is a big difference between the existence of knowledge in some other place and its availability to the right people in the right place at the right time. The crux of the matter is knowing how to integrate and organize fragmented, scattered and thinly spread knowledge.

**Alexis de Tocqueville** *Democracy in America*
  > In democratic countries, knowledge of how to combine is the mother of all forms of knowledge; on its progress depends that of all others.

**Alessandro Ludovico**
  > A typical bibliography at the end of a book is in fact much more sophisticated than even the most ingenious ‘advanced search’, since it is the result of a thoughtful and time-consuming effort of searching and making connections – a process which is fundamentally different from the mere linking of items through search terms or similar queries by other users, which relies only on direct, explicit links. But our brain is of course much more subtle and sophisticated than that; the associations (or ‘links’) it is able to make are based on the abstraction of experience, sometimes even on sheer instinct.

**Christopher Alexander** [*A City is Not a Tree*](https://www.patternlanguage.com/archive/cityisnotatree.html#)
  > here are virtually no closed groups of people in modern society. The reality of today's social structure is thick with overlap—the systems of friends and acquaintances form a semilattice, not a tree.


**David Bohm** [*On dialogue*](https://www.worldcat.org/title/on-dialogue/oclc/34798081&referer=brief_results#borrow)
  > ...communication can lead to the creation of something new only if people are able freely to listen to each other, without prejudice, and without trying to influence each other. Each has to be interested primarily in truth and coherence, so that he is ready to drop his old ideas and intentions, and be ready to go on to something different, when this is called for.

**Albert Camus** [*Create Dangerously*](https://www.worldcat.org/title/create-dangerously/oclc/1127571317&referer=brief_results)
  > Great ideas, it has been said, come into the world as gently as doves. Perhaps then, if we listen, attentively, we shall hear, amid the uproar of empires and nations, a faint flutter of wings, the gentle stirring of life and hope.

**Dave Weinberger** [*The Hyperlilnked Organization*](https://www.cluetrain.com/book/hyperorg.html)
  > You can only have a conversation if you’re not afraid to be wrong...To converse, you have to be willing to be wrong in front of another person.

**Clay Shirky** [*Cognitive Surplus*](https://www.worldcat.org/title/cognitive-surplus-creativity-and-generosity-in-a-connected-age/oclc/466335766)
  > ...people don't behave in ways they don't have the opportunity to behave in.

**Martin Creed** [*Art now : interviews with modern artists.*](https://www.worldcat.org/title/art-now-interviews-with-modern-artists/oclc/50301446)
  > The only thing I feel like I know is that I want to make things. Other than that, I feel like I don’t know. So the problem is in trying to make something without knowing what I want. [...] I think it’s all to do with wanting to communicate. I mean, I think I want to make things because I want to communicate with people, because I want to be loved, because I want to express myself.

**Jeremy Ruston**
  >  ...we live in a world mediated by software and yet for most of the population software is an inscrutable thing requiring absurd investment to understand and exploit. So most people end up using mass market software that was designed for somebody else, and never for you.

**Kirsten Dirksen** [*Summer of (family) love: tiny home VW-roadtrip documentary*](https://faircompanies.com/videos/summer-of-family-love-tiny-home-vw-roadtrip-documentary/)
  > One of the most elusive goals in life is determining just what you need to live.

**Stewart Brand** [*Whole Earth Catalogue, Fall 1968*]
  > A realm of intimate, personal power is developing - power of the individual to conduct his own education, find his own inspiration, shape his own environment, and share his adventure with whoever is interested.

**Brian Eno**
  > Control and surrender have to be kept in balance. That’s what surfers do—take control of the situation, then be carried, then take control.

**James Scott** [*Seeing Like a State*](https://www.worldcat.org/title/seeing-like-a-state-how-certain-schemes-to-improve-the-human-condition-have-failed/oclc/37392803)
  > State simplifications such as maps, censuses, cadastral list, and standard unites of measurement represent techniques for grasping a large and complex reality; in order for officials to be able to comprehend aspects of the ensemble, that complex reality must be reduced to schematic categories. The only way to accomplish this is to reduce an infinite array of detail to a set of categories that will facilitate summary descriptions, comparisons and aggregation.

**Kanye West**
  > I know I don’t know. If i thought i did. I’d put out some bullshit. The fact that I know that I’m not on that level right now, gives me the area to learn. It’s ike being a child. Because I'm alway looking. Searching for new shit. Alway looks for art in everything. As you make more you always see something else. The point when you're satisfied is when you’re dead. You should never bee completely satisfied.

**David Foster Wallace** [*2005 commencement address at Kenyon College*](https://www.1843magazine.com/story/david-foster-wallace-in-his-own-words)
  > ...blind certainty, a close-mindedness that amounts to an imprisonment so total that the prisoner doesn't even know he's locked up.

**Robert Greene** [*Mastery*](https://www.worldcat.org/title/mastery/oclc/779263539)
  > If we feel like we know something, our minds close off to other possibilities. We see reflections of the truth we’ve already assumed. Such feeling of superiority are often unconscious and stem from a fear of what is different or unknown.
