# Coffee


## Tasting
*A living list of coffees that, after having the first cup, I wanted another.*

| **Roaster** | **Type** | **Origin** | **Name/Region** | **First Cup** | **Notes** | **Brew method**
|:---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |:----| :----|
| Andytown | Blend | | "Wind and Sea" | 25-April-2020 | Wonderfully balanced; creamy in the mouth and a bit tangy in a Strauss yogurt kind of way...need to try this one again! | Japanese-style iced coffee |
| Home roaste batch [#81](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aH58w2qIBGqEbM_Dfpmq_KhUNhTc48ZHuMJqiuyN_lY/edit#gid=0) | single origin | Kenya | Othaya Gura AB |5-Apr-2020 | After three roasts, I think I've got this bean dialed. It's a balanced cup with a rich and smooth body that reminds me of coconut oil. The sourness/sweetness of the cup is enough to be noticeable without being overpowering...reminds me of a green apple without its skin.
|XELA Coffee Roasters| single origin | Honduras | Alto de Los Santos (farm) | 30 Nov 2019 | Smell: sweet and fruity; Body: medium and substantial (good for the morning); Taste: blueberry-like sweetness that finishes with the richness of carmel
| [Heart Coffee](https://www.heartroasters.com) | single origin | Kenya | Kiambu | 7 Oct 2019 |Wonderful medium body (great for a morning cup) with a grapefruit-like finish
| Home roasted | Single origin | San Jose de Lourdes, Peru | Caserio Buenos Aires | 14 Sep 2019 | Starts off bright and juicy, like biting into an apple and then gradually slides into a rich, but not too rich, dark chocolate, medium-bodied coffee
| [Café Villarías](https://cafevillarias.com) | blend (caracolillo + planchuela beans) | Chiapas, Mexico | Mezcla de la casa | 4 May 2019 | This is what I've come to want and expect from a breakfast coffee: a kind of body that weighs in my mouth just enough to appreciate it, notes that are clear (in this case dark chocolate) and knowable enough that I have the language/a framework/a place to start thinking more about it. There are also other things going on (maybe a bit of smokiness?) that create enough curiosity for me to look forward to tomorrow morning's cup to see what else unravels.|
| La Colombe | single origin | China-Yunnan | Fuyan County, Yunnan Province | 24 Nov 2018 | Smooth and balanced with a milk-chocolate sweetness. Eager to try it again to unpack what else is going on in there.|
| Blue Bottle | single origin | North Sumatra, Indonesia | *Sumatra Lake Toba Blue Batak* | 6 Nov 2018 | It's almost like each sip has "time"...it starts with a pleasant acidity that turns into sweetness and finishes with the richness and silkiness of coconut oil without being overwhelming at any point.
| Verve | single origin | Guatemala | *Santa Clara Pacamara* | October, 2018 | Subtly sharp, with just enough sweetness to make inoffensive. Good body. Drinks like a cup of coffee i could have many times, not tire of and continue to find new things to notice.
| Home roasted | single origin | Ethiopia | *Hambela Hassan* | August, 2018 | bright with body; delightful for the morning |
| heart | single origin | Colombia | | *Fabio Escobar* | August, 2018 |
| Ritual | single origin | Colombia | *El Guamo* | Jul 2018
| Verve | single origin | Honduras | *El Brujo* | Jul 2018
| Equator | single origin | Costa Rica | *Costa Rica Beneficio Santa Rosa 1900* | Jul 2018
| George Howell | single origin | Rwanda | *Kanzu* |  Apr 2018
| Wrecking Ball | single origin | Peru | *Peru Saltillo Finca Tasta* |  Apr 2018
| Blue Bottle | single origin | Guatemala | *Cobán Santa Isabel Caturra* |  January, 2018

## Notes

#### Equipment
**Fresh Roast SR 340**
- I value the built-in cooling cycle. It brings the beans down from temperature quickly. This has helped me be more precise with roasts as I no longer need to consider how the beans continue to roast once the roaster's power cuts off.

#### Tasting
I wonder if taste can have speed. Speed as in body (light = fast; heavy = slow). Speed as in tasting notes: *Do the flavors reveal themselves immediately upfront? Do the flavors change/unravel as the coffee sits in your mouth? Are they flavors you want to keep in your mouth for a while?* Chocolate, for example, is something I enjoy letting melt in my mouth, wanting to savor the small bite for as long as i can.

And if there is something to tastes having "speed" – are there certain foods I prefer at different times because of how quickly or slowly they "eat" or "drink"? is there anything to preferring slower coffees in the morning? coffees that lead me to slow down, savor and appreciate?
