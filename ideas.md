## ideas

what other kinds of "items" do i accumulate?


###  meta

+ [ ]  how should private items be handled?
+ [ ]  should "pace" be represented in a document? how?


###  coffee roasting
#### stream
my intention right now is all about workflow: optimal batch weight, chaff removal, logging, cooling, etc. but roasting just twice has brought renewed focus to, what feel like, the many holes in my knowledge: developing better baseline taste profiles for diff. regions, identifying different roast profiles, etc. i'm eager to answer them, but more so excited that they feel almost important. "important" maybe because i immediately know where and how i'll apply their eventual answers?

#### top of mind
+  **free time:**  what part(s) of peoples' days/weeks do they consider "free"? what do people expect from "free time"?
+ **faith:**
+  **longevity:**  what can i start doing now to improve my chances of being able to run comfortably for the next 40 years?
+  **community:** in what new ways are people working and living together?

#### still there, somewhere
+  **improvisation:** in what creative ways do people reimagine the unconscious, routine  practices of everyday life?

###  quotes
+ *"...through the act of writing I wanted to sort out what kind of life I've led."* Haruki Murakami writing in [What I Talk About When I Talk About Running](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_I_Talk_About_When_I_Talk_About_Running)
+ Thinking about Stewart Brand's [Pace Layers](http://blog.longnow.org/02015/01/27/stewart-brand-pace-layers-thinking-at-the-interval/) again:
*"It's the combination of the fast and the slow parts that give a whole system its resilience. Because the fast parts learn; the slow parts remember. The fast parts propose things; the slow parts dispose things...The fast and small instruct the slow and big."* [Stewart Brand](https://youtu.be/VugDxZW0VHA?t=6m18s)+

###  books
+ *Rural Studio – Samual Mockbee and an Architecture of Decency* [Andrea Oppenheimer Dean and Timothy Hursley]: Story about what architecture can accomplish when designers fully accept their responsibility to the people their structures will protect and the environments and communities in which they will exist. Timothy Hursley's photography does a wonderful job representing this message.
+  *Making is Connecting* [David Gauntlett]: No revelatory moments, but an easygoing read. It incrementally advanced the internal conversation i’ve been having about the value and opportunity for creativity in everyday "operations."
