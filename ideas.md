## ideas

what other kinds of "items" do i accumulate?


###  meta
*things are starting to feel messy.*
+ [ ]  how should private items be handled?
+ [ ]  should "pace" be represented in a document? how?
	+ by pace i'm meaning like how fast the document moves or changes. so of the documents created thus far, "ideas" would be the fastest moving because it's become kind of like a catch all.
+ [ ] how might outside collaboration work?



###  coffee roasting
#### stream
**questions to self:** *what have you noticed about the process? what would you like to improve? where do you feel like your gaps in knowledge are?*

**8/22:**  tasted the first roast of the [ethiopian beans](https://www.sweetmarias.com/ethiopia-wet-process-hambela-hassan.html); they were good*. curious to compare it with the [heart ethiopian](https://www.heartroasters.com/collections/beans/products/ethiopia-gedeb) beans i have.

\*i'm wanting a better/more nuanced way of noting tastes.

**8/21:** my intention right now is all about workflow: optimal batch weight, chaff removal, logging, cooling, etc. but roasting just twice has brought renewed focus to, what feel like, the many holes in my knowledge: developing better baseline tastes for diff. regions, identifying different roast profiles, etc. i'm eager to answer them, but more so excited that they feel almost important. "important" maybe because i immediately know where and how i'll apply their answers when i eventually arrive at them?

#### top of mind
+  **improvisation:** consumption/everyday routines as acts of resistance/protest. I wonder if time fits here. The question I have in mind here is something like: *how much of each day do you feel like you have an intention for?* Or maybe this is better suited for **free time**?
+ **faith:** i don't have a specific question in mind per se...it's more that i've become interested in finding the language to articulate my own.
+ **longevity:**  is how i think about running and what i expect from it sustainable? what about my running practice do i need to maintain or change to improve my chances of being able to run comfortably for the next 40 years?
+  **community:** in what new ways are people working and living together?

#### still there, somewhere
+  **free time:**  what part(s) of peoples' days/weeks do they consider "free"? what do people expect from "free time"?

###  quotes
+ "Easy things should be easy, and hard things should be possible." -[Larry Wall](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Larry_Wall#Other)
+ *"...through the act of writing I wanted to sort out what kind of life I've led."* Haruki Murakami writing in [What I Talk About When I Talk About Running](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_I_Talk_About_When_I_Talk_About_Running)
+ Thinking about Stewart Brand's [Pace Layers](http://blog.longnow.org/02015/01/27/stewart-brand-pace-layers-thinking-at-the-interval/) again:
*"It's the combination of the fast and the slow parts that give a whole system its resilience. Because the fast parts learn; the slow parts remember. The fast parts propose things; the slow parts dispose things...The fast and small instruct the slow and big."* [Stewart Brand](https://youtu.be/VugDxZW0VHA?t=6m18s)+

###  books
#### reading
*[Cognitive Surplus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_Surplus)* [Clay Shirky]

#### read
+ [Siddhartha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siddhartha_(novel)) *by [Herman Hesse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Hesse)*. "I am not going anywhere. I am only on the way." This message resonated with me most. Sometimes when I read a book I'm not sure whether I liked the book as much as I liked the author's articulation of thoughts that had previously existed amorphously in my mind. Siddhartha fits into this category for me.
+ [Rural Studio â€“ Samual Mockbee and an Architecture of Decency](https://books.google.com/books/about/Rural_Studio.html?id=Cjy8Mt4hn_QC&source=kp_book_description) [Andrea Oppenheimer Dean and Timothy Hursley]: Story about what architecture can accomplish when designers fully accept their responsibility to the people their structures will protect and the environments and communities in which they will exist. Timothy Hursley's photography does a wonderful job representing this message.
+  [Making is Connecting](https://books.google.com/books/about/Making_is_Connecting.html?id=4-X-twEACAAJ&source=kp_book_description) *by [David Gauntlett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Gauntlett)*: No revelatory moments, but an easygoing read. It incrementally advanced my internal conversation about the opportunity for creativity in everyday "operations."
