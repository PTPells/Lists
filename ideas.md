###  questions
*i've been surprised by how consistently asking someone a familiar question, in an unexpected way, leads to an  interaction i end up being glad for having had:*

+  *How are you telling time at the moment?*
+  *What is resonating with you right now?*
+  *Is there a thought that's been recurring in your mind, but that maybe hasn't advanced?*

###  quotes
+  Thining about Stewart Brand's "Pace Layers" again: 
*"It's the combination of the fast and the slow parts that give a whole system its resilience. Because the fast parts learn; the slow parts remember. The fast parts propose things; the slow parts dispose things...The fast and small instruct the slow and big."* [Stewart Brand](https://youtu.be/VugDxZW0VHA?t=6m18s)
