## ideas



###  meta
Feeling good. I have a sense for how things should be for now.

+ [x ] how do i handle linking?
	+ Let's try a link to [concepts](https://github.com/PTPells/Lists/blob/master/concepts.md)

#### top of mind
+ **"What are different ways online communities build 'stock' together?"**
+ **Context/Understanding:** *In what context was this author writing? Who or what might they have been responding to? Who might've affected how they've come to think about a particular topic? What state was the conversation on this particular topic at the time of writing? Were there macro events that, in hindsight, people recognize as having influenced how people thought about a particular topic?* I find myself asking questions about context more of late.
    + It was William Coperthwaite writing, "Design gradually came to mean to me that certain quality whereby a well shaped spoon works." that reminded me of Christopher Alexander's "quality without a name" that now me wondering what might explain how they might've arrived at such similar language.
+ **Accessibility/Inclusivity/Legibility/Participation/Co-design:** William Coperthwaite explains what I'm coming to believe in more strongly, "The finest design for society will not be one worked up by specialists but a design created by the people themselves to fit their needs."
  + And [Kenya Hara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenya_Hara): "A city is not made by commissioning wonderfully talented architects. Instead, a city results from the competing desires of a large number of people … When people stop dropping litter, or spitting on the street, the city moves forward a step. When graffiti disappears, broken streetlights aren’t left unfixed, and public toilets start to stay clean by themselves, the city has moved one step closer to sophistication. Design can educate people’s desires and help cities grown in that way. This is not a dogma. Rather it is the ability to help people notice something special: like the instant when they use an unpatterned towel made from a material with a pleasant feel.”
+ **faith:** i don't have a specific question in mind per se...it's more that i've become interested in finding the language to articulate my own.
	+ Christopher Alexander writing: "It is reason—the language of science, and its appeal to shareable, empirical observation and reasoning—that has given our modern era its strength. Yet one is unlikely to encounter God on the basis of reason."
+ **longevity:**  is how i think about running and what i expect from it sustainable? what about my running practice do i need to maintain or change to improve my chances of being able to run comfortably for the next 40 years?
	+ *"Cold muscles don't work."* Take the first mile slow. Once I'm warm, it's okay to get going.



###  coffee roasting
#### stream
**questions to self:** *what have you noticed about the process? what would you like to improve? where do you feel like your gaps in knowledge are?*

**8/22:**  tasted the first roast of the [ethiopian beans](https://www.sweetmarias.com/ethiopia-wet-process-hambela-hassan.html); they were good*. curious to compare it with the [heart ethiopian](https://www.heartroasters.com/collections/beans/products/ethiopia-gedeb) beans i have.

\*i'm wanting a better/more nuanced way of noting tastes.

**8/21:** my intention right now is all about workflow: optimal batch weight, chaff removal, logging, cooling, etc. but roasting just twice has brought renewed focus to, what feel like, the many holes in my knowledge: developing better baseline tastes for diff. regions, identifying different roast profiles, etc. i'm eager to answer them, but more so excited that they feel almost important. "important" maybe because i immediately know where and how i'll apply their answers when i eventually arrive at them?



#### still there, somewhere
+  **free time:**  what part(s) of peoples' days/weeks do they consider "free"? what do people expect from "free time"?
+  **improvisation:** consumption/everyday routines as acts of resistance/protest. I wonder if time fits here. The question I have in mind here is something like: *how much of each day do you feel like you have an intention for?* Or maybe this is better suited for **free time**?
+  **community:** in what new ways are people working and living together?



### people
+  **[Frederick Law Olmstead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Law_Olmsted) (1822-1903)**: **landscape architect** (Central Park, Prospect Park, Stanford University Campus, U.S. Capitol grounds) and **conservationist** (Yosemite)

###  quotes
+ "These theories were focused on the search for a deeper sense of well-being—not thermal comfort or energy saving, but a deeper psychological and emotional comfort, in which people could feel their own existence as human beings." -Christopher Alexander
+ “If you want to teach people a new way of thinking, don’t bother trying to teach them. Instead, give them a tool, the use of which will lead to new ways of thinking.” — R. Buckminster Fuller
+ "Rather than making a chair to sleep in or a machine to live it, it is better to make a bed. A straight chair is best for eating or writing. The third position is standing." [Donald Judd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Judd) on [furniture](https://web.archive.org/web/20140103044123/http://www.juddfoundation.org/furniture/essay.htm).
+ **"A resource arrangement that works in practice can work in theory."** [Lee Anne Fennell](https://www.thecommonsjournal.org/articles/10.18352/ijc.252/) writing of [Ostrom's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elinor_Ostrom#Ostrom's_law)
	+ Bottom up.
+ "Easy things should be easy, and hard things should be possible." -[Larry Wall](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Larry_Wall#Other)
+ *"...through the act of writing I wanted to sort out what kind of life I've led."* Haruki Murakami writing in [What I Talk About When I Talk About Running](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_I_Talk_About_When_I_Talk_About_Running)
+ Thinking about Stewart Brand's [Pace Layers](http://blog.longnow.org/02015/01/27/stewart-brand-pace-layers-thinking-at-the-interval/) again:
*"It's the combination of the fast and the slow parts that give a whole system its resilience. Because the fast parts learn; the slow parts remember. The fast parts propose things; the slow parts dispose things...The fast and small instruct the slow and big."* [Stewart Brand](https://youtu.be/VugDxZW0VHA?t=6m18s)+

###  books
#### reading



#### want to read
+ [Economics of Knowledge](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/economics-knowledge) by Dominique Foray

#### read
**[The Wikipedia Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wikipedia_Revolution)** *by* [Andrew Lih](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Lih)  

Smooth and engaging. Little fluff. I like how holistically Lih approached the task of capturing Wikipedia's history. Sharing context around many of the components that have contributed to Wikipedia being/becoming what it is. Examples: content licensing (Copyleft), software patterns (Ward Cunningham's WikiWikiWeb), community policies (ArbCom, WP:BLP), etc. Also, a ton of great reference links to essays/articles written about/in response to the movement.  

I'm left wanting to develop my opinion of how well positioned I think Wikipedia is in achieving it's vision of a world where, "...every single human being can freely share in the sum of all knowledge." Is it well adapted to today's context and future expectations? Also, what is Wikipedia? How do Wikipedians talk about Wikipedia? What are their expectations of it? How do WMF staff talk about Wikipedia? What are their expectations of it? What do I think Wikipedia is?  

“The problem, like all those with which we are concerned, is one of balance. Too little liberty brings stagnation and too much brings chaos.” [Bertrand Russell].

+ **[A Handmade Life: In Search of Simplicity](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/742734-a-handmade-life-in-search-of-simplicity)** *by* [Bill Coperwaite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Coperthwaite) recommended by [Jeff](http://github.com/jnoh).

   The first quarter was rich and inspiring. Coperthwaite's case for the necessity of being an active participant in and designer of, your own life resonated. Although, as the book wore on, he started to rant which gave me pause. Although, the wonderful writings he included from people like Maurice Mitchel, Richard Gregg, Scott Nearing, Wendell Berry, Christopher Alexander, Ralph Waldo Emerson and John B. Calhoun kept me reading. Cool to see his thinking in the context of those he was influenced by.

	 I'm left thinking about...

	 + This thought on getting started: *Initially what is important is to be able to successfully make a useful object over which the maker can exclaim, with pleasure and amazement, 'I made this myself!'*
	 + The potential, and therefore, responsibility we all bear in making the world more "beautiful."

+ **[Cognitive Surplus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_Surplus)** *by* Clay Shirky

	 Reading seven years after its publication, Shirky's optimism for a society where individuals share, collaborate and more broadly, "participate" to create public value feels fresh.* Not only fresh, but young/nascent. I believe we are just starting to tap into the idle potential that exists between people.  In this way, I'm finishing *Cognitive Surplus* feeling excited. Excited about a future where our tools, as Jimmy Wales put it, "...empower lots of pople to do good work, cooperatively."

	 \* *Am I late? Linux and Apache (read: open source software), Wikipedia and "crowdsourcing" in general has obviously been around for some time. So why does this idea feel novel to me? Am I unique in feeling this way? I'm not quite sure yet, but I'm also not sure how pressed I am for these answers.*
+ **[Siddhartha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siddhartha_(novel))** *by* [Herman Hesse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Hesse)

	 "I am not going anywhere. I am only on the way." This message resonated with me most. Sometimes when I read a book I'm not sure whether I liked the book as much as I liked the author's articulation of thoughts that had previously existed amorphously in my mind. Siddhartha fits into this category for me.

+ **[Rural Studio – Samual Mockbee and an Architecture of Decency](https://books.google.com/books/about/Rural_Studio.html?id=Cjy8Mt4hn_QC&source=kp_book_description)** *by* Andrea Oppenheimer Dean and Timothy Hursley:

	 Story about what architecture can accomplish when designers fully accept their responsibility to the people their structures will protect and the environments and communities in which they will exist. Timothy Hursley's photography does a wonderful job representing this message as well.

+  **[Making is Connecting](https://books.google.com/books/about/Making_is_Connecting.html?id=4-X-twEACAAJ&source=kp_book_description)** *by* [David Gauntlett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Gauntlett)

	 No revelatory moments, but an easygoing read. It incrementally advanced my internal conversation about the opportunity for creativity in everyday "operations."
