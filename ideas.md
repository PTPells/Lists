## Meta
Reading section keeps expanding, I haven't touched "coffee roasting" since August, my quotes accumulation is now split across multiple workflows...point being, I think I'd benefit from breaking some sections out into their own jogs. I like the idea of using this place to be a record of what's top of mind, be it an idea, a quote, a YouTuber, etc. Basically, I imagine this being one of the fastest moving notes I maintain.






## Top of mind
+ "When we know those moments, when we smile, when we let go, when we are not on guard at all – these are the moments when our most important forces show themselves; whatever you are doing at such a moment, hold on to it, repeat it – for that certain smile is the best knowledge that we ever have of what our hidden forces are, and where they lie, and how they can be loosed." [Christopher Alexander]
+ **Context/Understanding:** *In what context was this author writing? Who or what might they have been responding to? Who might've affected how they've come to think about a particular topic? What state was the conversation on this particular topic at the time of writing? Were there macro events that, in hindsight, people recognize as having influenced how people thought about a particular topic?* I find myself asking questions about context more of late.
    + It was William Coperthwaite writing, "Design gradually came to mean to me that certain quality whereby a well shaped spoon works." that reminded me of Christopher Alexander's "quality without a name" that now me wondering what might explain how they might've arrived at such similar language.
	+ I think the larger point here is that to promote deeper understanding information needs to be placed in a broader context...may doing so makes it easier to establish its significance?
+ **Accessibility/Inclusivity/Legibility/Participation/Co-design:** William Coperthwaite explains what I'm coming to believe in more strongly, "The finest design for society will not be one worked up by specialists but a design created by the people themselves to fit their needs."
  + And [Kenya Hara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenya_Hara): "A city is not made by commissioning wonderfully talented architects. Instead, a city results from the competing desires of a large number of people … When people stop dropping litter, or spitting on the street, the city moves forward a step. When graffiti disappears, broken streetlights aren’t left unfixed, and public toilets start to stay clean by themselves, the city has moved one step closer to sophistication. Design can educate people’s desires and help cities grown in that way. This is not a dogma. Rather it is the ability to help people notice something special: like the instant when they use an unpatterned towel made from a material with a pleasant feel.”
+ **faith:** i don't have a specific question in mind per se...it's more that i've become interested in finding the language to articulate my own.
	+ Christopher Alexander writing: "It is reason—the language of science, and its appeal to shareable, empirical observation and reasoning—that has given our modern era its strength. Yet one is unlikely to encounter God on the basis of reason."
+ **longevity:**  is how i think about running and what i expect from it sustainable? what about my running practice do i need to maintain or change to improve my chances of being able to run comfortably for the next 40 years?
	+ *"Cold muscles don't work."* Take the first mile slow. Once I'm warm, it's okay to get going.



## Coffee roasting
#### **26 October 2018**  
Twenty five [roasts](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aH58w2qIBGqEbM_Dfpmq_KhUNhTc48ZHuMJqiuyN_lY/edit?usp=sharing) later...

**Blends vs. single origins**
It's now been two weeks since I had, what I understand to be, Sightglass's [Hunky Dory](https://sightglasscoffee.com/products/hunky-dory) blend at Chez Panisse. I'm still thinking about it. Great body, chocolaty, well balanced...I have no better way to describe this coffee than saying it tasted like it should. Let me try to unpack that...

My exposure to coffee before high school was limited: coffee ice cream at my grandmother's and an occasional taste from my dad's cup, decorated with cream and sugar. Rich, ever-so-sweet...consistent, uneventful, safe, but spectacular for all those reasons. For some years, this was coffee to me. The flavor profile I came to expect and sought in coffee. At some point, I began to approach coffee differently, seeking more variety by way of single origins and drinking it black.

I've carried this thinking through my coffee roasting exploration. Experimenting with different regions and lately, different production methods within those regions to tease distinct notes within each. Each shop, roast and taste becomes eventful.

But the french pressed [Hunky Dory](https://sightglasscoffee.com/products/hunky-dory) Chez Panisse reminded me how comforting and fulfilling an uneventful cup of coffee can be. The kind of coffee that's invisible. The kind of coffee that doesn't talk to you..there is no active conversation or negotiation between me and the coffee about what it tastes like or whether certain notes are pronounced to a distracting extreme. All to say, I'm excited about blends and even more so excited to have a model cup of coffee to try to emulate as a starting point.

**Set up**
Recently, as in these past 2 roasts, I've begun paying more attention to the smoke produced during roasting. I'd smelled the smoke since the beginning, but I hadn't considered it a problem to be solved (roasts are never more than 6 minutes) until seeing the smoke during a morning roast last week. There's a lot of it.

For now, I've elevated the "roaster" such that the smoke can [ideally] exhaust outside. But wouldn't you know, the rush of cool air from outside into our warm apartment hasn't been helpful (see the [chaff](https://github.com/PTPells/Lists/blob/master/assets/coffee-exhaust-2.jpeg)). More experimenting to come.

Oh and some other tweaks:
+ To cool down beans more quickly, I'm now storing our mesh strainers (which I use to cool) in the freezer
+ Now letting the freshly roasted coffee sit out for 6-8 hours before bagging it
+ Allowing the "roaster" to warm up for 5 minutes instead of the 3 minutes I'd been doing before



**22 August 2018**  
	tasted the first roast of the [ethiopian beans](https://www.sweetmarias.com/ethiopia-wet-process-hambela-hassan.html); they were good*. curious to compare it with the [heart ethiopian](https://www.heartroasters.com/collections/beans/products/ethiopia-gedeb) beans i have.

\*i'm wanting a better/more nuanced way of noting tastes.

**21 August 2018**
	my intention right now is all about workflow: optimal batch weight, chaff removal, logging, cooling, etc. but roasting just twice has brought renewed focus to, what feel like, the many holes in my knowledge: developing better baseline tastes for diff. regions, identifying different roast profiles, etc. i'm eager to answer them, but more so excited that they feel almost important. "important" maybe because i immediately know where and how i'll apply their answers when i eventually arrive at them?



#### still there, somewhere
+  **free time:**  what part(s) of peoples' days/weeks do they consider "free"? what do people expect from "free time"?
+  **improvisation:** consumption/everyday routines as acts of resistance/protest. I wonder if time fits here. The question I have in mind here is something like: *how much of each day do you feel like you have an intention for?* Or maybe this is better suited for **free time**?
+  **community:** in what new ways are people working and living together?

## Quotes
+ *"These theories were focused on the search for a deeper sense of well-being—not thermal comfort or energy saving, but a deeper psychological and emotional comfort, in which people could feel their own existence as human beings."* -Christopher Alexander

## Reading
#### Currently
**[Nonzero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonzero:_The_Logic_of_Human_Destiny)** *by* [Robert Wright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Wright_(journalist)) recommended by Danny Horn
	↳ 24 October 2018 -
A third of the way through and this is starting to open up for me. I like how he has begun to describe the models on which earlier scholars and archaeologists have built their understanding of human advancement. His critique of their static and climactic views for how, what [Wright thinks] can be seen more accurately as revolutionary changes that happened in evolutionary ways resonates.



#### Finished
**[Economics of Knowledge](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/economics-knowledge)** *by* Dominique Foray      
	↳ 2 October 2018 - 24 October 2018  

I enjoyed this for the vocabulary and frameworks it's given me to think about knowledge creation (scientific exploration vs. learning-by-doing), dissemination (codified vs. tacit), absorption (integration) and how intellectual property laws incentivize the process.

Immediately after finishing I'm left thinking about the tension between tacit and codified knowledge. Tacit knowledge is practical and flexible, but difficult to diffuse. Codified knowledge is structured and easily transferred, but it can create a kind of lock in to obsolete ways of thinking. Oh and a great bibliography.

**[The Wikipedia Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wikipedia_Revolution)** *by* [Andrew Lih](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Lih)  

Smooth and engaging. Little fluff. I like how holistically Lih approached the task of capturing Wikipedia's history. Sharing context around many of the components that have contributed to Wikipedia being/becoming what it is. Examples: content licensing (Copyleft), software patterns (Ward Cunningham's WikiWikiWeb), community policies (ArbCom, WP:BLP), etc. Also, a ton of great reference links to essays/articles written about/in response to the movement.  

I'm left wanting to develop my opinion of how well positioned I think Wikipedia is in achieving it's vision of a world where, "...every single human being can freely share in the sum of all knowledge." Is it well adapted to today's context and future expectations? Also, what is Wikipedia? How do Wikipedians talk about Wikipedia? What are their expectations of it? How do WMF staff talk about Wikipedia? What are their expectations of it? What do I think Wikipedia is?  

“The problem, like all those with which we are concerned, is one of balance. Too little liberty brings stagnation and too much brings chaos.” [Bertrand Russell].

**[A Handmade Life: In Search of Simplicity](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/742734-a-handmade-life-in-search-of-simplicity)** *by* [Bill Coperwaite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Coperthwaite) recommended by [Jeff](http://github.com/jnoh).

 The first quarter was rich and inspiring. Coperthwaite's case for the necessity of being an active participant in and designer of, your own life resonated. Although, as the book wore on, he started to rant which gave me pause. Although, the wonderful writings he included from people like Maurice Mitchel, Richard Gregg, Scott Nearing, Wendell Berry, Christopher Alexander, Ralph Waldo Emerson and John B. Calhoun kept me reading. Cool to see his thinking in the context of those he was influenced by.

 I'm left thinking about...

 + This thought on getting started: *Initially what is important is to be able to successfully make a useful object over which the maker can exclaim, with pleasure and amazement, 'I made this myself!'*
 + The potential, and therefore, responsibility we all bear in making the world more "beautiful."

**[Cognitive Surplus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_Surplus)** *by* Clay Shirky

 Reading seven years after its publication, Shirky's optimism for a society where individuals share, collaborate and more broadly, "participate" to create public value feels fresh.* Not only fresh, but young/nascent. I believe we are just starting to tap into the idle potential that exists between people.  In this way, I'm finishing *Cognitive Surplus* feeling excited. Excited about a future where our tools, as Jimmy Wales put it, "...empower lots of pople to do good work, cooperatively."

 \* *Am I late? Linux and Apache (read: open source software), Wikipedia and "crowdsourcing" in general has obviously been around for some time. So why does this idea feel novel to me? Am I unique in feeling this way? I'm not quite sure yet, but I'm also not sure how pressed I am for these answers.*

**[Siddhartha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siddhartha_(novel))** *by* [Herman Hesse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Hesse)

"I am not going anywhere. I am only on the way." This message resonated with me most. Sometimes when I read a book I'm not sure whether I liked the book as much as I liked the author's articulation of thoughts that had previously existed amorphously in my mind. Siddhartha fits into this category for me.

**[Rural Studio – Samual Mockbee and an Architecture of Decency](https://books.google.com/books/about/Rural_Studio.html?id=Cjy8Mt4hn_QC&source=kp_book_description)** *by* Andrea Oppenheimer Dean and Timothy Hursley:

 Story about what architecture can accomplish when designers fully accept their responsibility to the people their structures will protect and the environments and communities in which they will exist. Timothy Hursley's photography does a wonderful job representing this message as well.

**[Making is Connecting](https://books.google.com/books/about/Making_is_Connecting.html?id=4-X-twEACAAJ&source=kp_book_description)** *by* [David Gauntlett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Gauntlett)

 No revelatory moments, but an easygoing read. It incrementally advanced my internal conversation about the opportunity for creativity in everyday "operations."
