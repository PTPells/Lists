###  quotes
+  Thinking about Stewart Brand's [Pace Layers](http://blog.longnow.org/02015/01/27/stewart-brand-pace-layers-thinking-at-the-interval/) again: 
*"It's the combination of the fast and the slow parts that give a whole system its resilience. Because the fast parts learn; the slow parts remember. The fast parts propose things; the slow parts dispose things...The fast and small instruct the slow and big."* [Stewart Brand](https://youtu.be/VugDxZW0VHA?t=6m18s)

###  books
+  *Making is Connecting* [David Gauntlett]: No revelatory moments, but an easygoing read. It incrementally advanced the internal conversation iâ€™ve been having about the value and opportunity for creativity in everyday "operations."
